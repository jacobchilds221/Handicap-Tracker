# Handicap-Tracker
A useful tool for tracking a golf handicap that conforms to the USGA rules.
Coded in Java, this program uses a class to write to a file and save the data.
It will use the guidelines provided by the USGA to calculate the handicap.

I'm very sports orientated and into golf, so I thought this would be a great
starting project.
